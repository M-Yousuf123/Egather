# Egather - A vedio confrencing app

Welcome to the official repository of our College Video Conferencing App! This project aims to facilitate seamless and secure virtual classrooms for our college students and faculty. With a focus on maintaining the integrity of online classes, our app requires students and faculty to log in using their enrollment numbers and faculty IDs, ensuring that only authorized individuals can participate and no outsiders can disrupt ongoing sessions.

In addition to the robust security measures, we are committed to enhancing the virtual learning experience. Our app will come equipped with a range of features tailored to the educational environment, including real-time video and audio communication, screen sharing for presentations, chat functionality for interactive discussions, and more. We understand the importance of replicating the in-person classroom atmosphere, and our app aims to provide a reliable platform for effective knowledge exchange while prioritizing security and user-friendly design. We look forward to building a stronger connected learning community with our College Video Conferencing App.
